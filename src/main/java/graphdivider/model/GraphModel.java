/**
 * Represents a graph in memory using the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format.
 *
 * The associated .csrrg file must contain exactly five lines, each line consisting of integer values separated by semicolons:
 *
 * 1. maxVerticesPerRow        - Maximum number of vertices in any row (single integer).
 * 2. rowPositions             - Array of row identifiers.
 * 3. rowStartIndices          - For each row, the index in adjacencyList where that rowâ€™s neighbors start.
 * 4. adjacencyList            - Flattened array of all neighbor vertex indices.
 * 5. adjacencyPointers        - For each vertex (in row order), the index in adjacencyList where its neighbor list begins.
